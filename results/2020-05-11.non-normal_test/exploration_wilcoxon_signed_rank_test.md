# Introduction
* Non parametric test
* equivalent to dependent t-test without assuming normality
* compare two sets of scores that come from the same participants
	- not sure this is a good assumption, that it are the same individuals
* For example, you could use a Wilcoxon signed-rank test to understand whether there was a difference in smokers' daily cigarette consumption before and after a 6 week hypnotherapy programme 

# Assumptions
* dependent variable should be continuous or ranked
	- OK
* Your independent variable should consist of two categorical, "related groups" or "matched pairs"
	- not very sure this condition is met
* The distribution of the differences between the two related groups (i.e., the distribution of differences between the scores of both groups of the independent variable; for example, the reaction time in a room with "blue lighting" and a room with "red lighting") needs to be symmetrical in shape.
	- I should test this!
