# How F-tests work in Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
* F-statistic to test the hypotheses
	- ratio of two variances 
* Given that F-tests evaluate the ratio of two variances, you might think itâ€™s only suitable for determining whether the variances are equal. Actually, it can do that and a lot more! 
*  F-tests can 
	- compare the fits of different models, 
	- test the overall significance in regression models, 
	- test specific terms in linear models, 
	- and determine whether a set of means are all equal.
