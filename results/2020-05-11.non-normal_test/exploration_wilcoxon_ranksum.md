# Intro
* the  Wilcoxon  rank-sum  test  is  a  nonparametric  alternative  to  the  two-samplet-test  which  is  based  solely  on  the  order  in  which  the  observationsfrom the two samples fall.
* Since the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test does not assume known distributions, it does not deal with parameters, and therefore we call it a non-parametric test.



* H0:A=B
	- H1: A>B
	- H1: A<B
	- H1: A!=B 

* The Wilcoxon test is based upon ranking thenA+nBobservations of thecombined sample.  Each observation has arank:  the smallest has rank 1, the2nd smallest rank 2, and so on.  The Wilcoxon rank-sum test statistic is thesum of the ranks for observations from one of the samples.  

# Assumptions
* The two samples are independent of one another
* Both sets have equal variance
