# First analysis
* look at first n positions of all the proteins (at least k observations)
    - for example first 50
    - for example at least 20 observations
* calculate for each position the difference between the predictions
    - for exported protein, subtract the signal peptide
* Plot the distribution of the differences
    - same way a MSA-prediction plot is made
    
# Second analysis
* look per pair at what position the signficant differences are 
* count significant difference for each position 
* plot those counts
