In previous section the biophysical features of cytoplasmic and periplasmic proteins were compared both globally and in function of residue position.
In this section, the difference of characteristics will be examined in more detail.
To achieve this, the UniProtKB databank was searched for structural twins,
homologues for which one sequence resides in the cytoplasm and one the periplasm.
The advantage of this approach is that structural twins have a very similar biophysical landscape,
making differences more likely to be related to the final protein location.
