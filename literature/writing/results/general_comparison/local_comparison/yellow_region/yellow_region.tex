In the yellow region (residue 28 to 36),
a sudden spike in propensity propensity towards sheet formation and early folding is observed in periplasmic proteins,
but not in cytoplasmic ones.
There is also an positive effect on backbone and sidechain rigidity,
and a negative effect on coil formation.
This behaviour seems to be very specific to periplasmic proteins,
occurring with a high enough frequency not to be averaged out over the 3,883 proteins.
The reason for the presence of this increased propensity towards sheet formation accompanied by early folding propensity remains unclear however, 
but could be an interesting subject for further research.
