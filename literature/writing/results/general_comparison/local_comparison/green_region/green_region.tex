The green region goes from residue 11 to 18.
Most noticeably, this is the only region over the whole length of cytoplasmic proteins that shows increased backbone flexibility.
In all other regions, backbone dynamics is averaged out over the dataset of 30,632 cytoplasmic proteins.
This suggest that this flexible region is a general feature.
This region also exist in periplasmic proteins, 
but there it is shifted a little bit to the C-terminal end and extended into the red region.
Reduced early folding propensity is observed with similar values for all cytoplasmic an periplasic proteins.
