The UniProtKB query retrieval REST API was utilised to download the protein sequences.
The query specified for proteins with annotations of the taxonomic class of Gammaproteobacteria, 
the desired cellular location,
and the presence or absence of a signal peptide (shown below).
Both proteins which had annotations generated by UniProtKB's automated pipelines and those backed by experimental evidence were included.
This resulted in a dataset of \textbf{1,970,892 cytoplasmic} and \textbf{109,278 periplasmic} proteins.
