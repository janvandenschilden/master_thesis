The C-terminal part of the signal peptide or C-region contains 3-7 residues,
with five giving the best cleavage efficiency.
Amino acids of the C-region are more neutral and polar, 
and adopt a propensity toward an extended $\beta$-conformation to provide a binding site for SPase.
One of the main cleave motifs is the AXA motif (\cite{von1984}).
It is situated on positions -3 and -1 relative to the cleavage site is universal,
occurring in prokaryotic, ER, and organellar signal peptides.
Other motifs are observed for lipoproteins and prepolin (\cite{paetzel2002}).
The exact C-region features depend on the secretory pathway and species.
