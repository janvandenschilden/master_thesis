The region located downstream from the cleavage site, but upstream from the mature protein,
is called export initiation domain pro-region.
It seems to be especially important in Bacteria 
as deletion of the pro-region will result in accumulation of protein in the cytoplasm 
and the formation of inclusion bodies.
Additionally, it affects the protein folding process.
This region can extend to a length of 30 amino acids,
but for bacterial signal peptides the first 6 residues are the most important 
as they can interact with the SPase
(\cite{auclair2012}).
It is composed of mainly neutral and acidic residues, and has therefore a negative charge.
Because of this, it interacts with the positively charged N-region to form a loop structure.
Residues near the cleavage site, especially at P1', are small and flexible 
to avoid steric hindrance when interacting with the SPase
(\cite{owji2018}).
