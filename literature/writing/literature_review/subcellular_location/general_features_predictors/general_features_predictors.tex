Even though signal peptides play an important role in protein translocation,
they are on their own insufficient to ensure this process.
Predictors like MatureP are able to separate cytoplasmic proteins from periplasmic ones 
with an AUC of 92 percent based features exclusively from the mature domains
(\cite{orfanoudaki2017}).
