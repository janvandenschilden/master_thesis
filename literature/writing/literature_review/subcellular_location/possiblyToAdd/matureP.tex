Protein trafficking has long been a field of interest.
Translocated proteins are easily recognized  by the presence of a signal peptide.
However, additional features need to be present in the mature domain to get to and be functional in the final destined location. 
Secretory proteins need features that promote flexibility to keep it in a non-folder during secretion.
However, once secreted, it still needs the ability to fold into a functional protein.
