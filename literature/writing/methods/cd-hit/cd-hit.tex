The bio-informatics tool cd-hit (\cite{fu2012}) clusters protein sequences by an sequence similarity threshold.
For example if a threshold of 90 percent is chosen,
the sequence identity between clusters is at most 90 percent.
Sequence identity within a cluster is more than 90 percent.
The command line version of this tool was used (as available from the Ubuntu repository).
Default parameters were used. 
The sequnece identity threshold depended on the analysis and was either 0.5 or 0.9. 
A python wrapper was written to use cd-hit in scripts (see appendix).
