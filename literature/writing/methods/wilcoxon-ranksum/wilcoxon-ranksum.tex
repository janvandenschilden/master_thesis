To test whether there was a significant difference between observations of two sets of data,
the Wilcoxon-ranksum test can be used.
It does not assume the data to be normally distributed,
making it more generally applicable.
The implementation of the python library \textit{scipy} was used.
It accepts two lists of observations as input,
and returns a statistic and a p-value. 
Lower p-values mean that de difference is more significant.
During the twin comparison of biophysical features, 
a threshold of 0.05 was set.
