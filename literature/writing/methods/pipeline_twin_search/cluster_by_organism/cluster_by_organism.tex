The \textit{tab} files generated in previous step contain for each protein 
the UniProtKB identifier,
the organism the protein originates from,
and the protein sequence.
A custom python script (for code see appendex sections \textit{clusterByOrganism.py}) clustered the proteins of the same organism together, 
and generated two \textit{fasta} files for each organism.
One containing the periplasmic proteins and one containing the cytoplasmic proteins.
