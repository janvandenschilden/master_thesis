UniProtKB provides a mapping service to map one database to another.
This service can be accessed both by web interface and API.
A wrapper was written in python to access the API.
To speed up the homology search for twin members,
the UniProtKB identifier was mapped to its UniRef50 cluster.
Different UniRef50 clusters have at most 50 percent sequence identity to each other, 
and members within a cluster have at least 50 percent sequence identity.
In a subsequent step, 
this UniRef50 cluster can be mapped back to a list of members it contains, 
efficiently providing a quick \textit{hack} to retrieve homologues in a fast way.
The UniRepKB mapping service was also used to retrieve PDB identifiers for the twins that had a structure available.
