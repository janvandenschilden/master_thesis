Blastp  (\cite{korf2003}) is a tool that performs a local sequence alignment of a protein sequence query on a target database.
Each set of proteins (periplasmic and cytoplasmic) was clustered by organism.
Within such cluster,
the command line version of blastp (available as package for Ubuntu) was used to search for homologues between cytoplasmic and periplasmic sequences, 
in this master thesis defined as twins.
The e-value threshold was set on 1e-10.
A python wrapper was implemented to use blastp in python scripts (see appendix).
