Early folding propensities, backbone and sidechain dynamics, and propensity towards the secondary structures helix, sheet and coil were predicted with EFoldMine (\cite{raimondi2017}).
To avoid overloading the memory,
biophysical predictions were generated in batches and stored to files,
and a parser was written to read these files.
